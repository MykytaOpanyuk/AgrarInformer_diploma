* DHT11 humidity/temperature sensor

DHT11 output calibrated digital signal. It utilizes exclusive 
digital-signal-collecting-technique and humidity sensing technology, 
assuring its reliability and stability. Its sensing elements is
connected with 8-bit single-chip computer.Every sensor of this model 
is temperature compensated and calibrated in accurate calibration
chamber and the calibration-coefficient is saved in OTP memory.
Small size & low consumption & long transmission distance(20m) 
enable DHT11 to be suited in all kinds of harsh application occasions. 
Single-row packaged with four pins, making the connection very convenient.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "dht11"
  - gpios: Should specify the GPIO connected to the sensor's data
    line, see "gpios property" in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.

Example:

&am33xx_pinmux {
        humidity_sensor {
                compatible = "dht11";
                gpios = <&gpio0 27 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
        };
};
